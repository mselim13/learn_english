## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- `maxToolAttempts` default increased from 25 to 90
- Bumped `llm_core` dependency to ^0.1.9

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- Bumped `llm_core` dependency to ^0.1.8 for tool calling stream visibility

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- `batchEmbed()` implementation: delegates to existing `embed()` (processes multiple messages in the embedding isolate).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Confirmed that parsed tool calls from llama.cpp outputs always include non-null, non-empty `LLMToolCall.id` values across supported formats (JSON, XML-style, and function-style), maintaining compatibility with `llm_core` tool-calling expectations.
- Added tests for `ToolCallParser` to verify that tool call IDs are populated correctly for downstream `toolCallId` usage.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Support for `StreamChatOptions` in `streamChat()` method
- Support for `chatResponse()` method for non-streaming complete responses
- Input validation for model names and messages
- Improved isolate-based inference handling

### Changed
- `streamChat()` now accepts optional `StreamChatOptions` parameter
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced documentation
